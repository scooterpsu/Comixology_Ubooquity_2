# Comixology theme for Ubooquity

A Comixology-based theme for Ubooquity.

~~Releases page for proper version updates, or download the folder from the repo for in-development features.~~

**You need to use a zipped release (comixology2.zip from the releases page, not a source code zip) for your first install, as it contains a settings.js file not included in the repo.**

To get things setup, be sure to check https://github.com/scooterpsu/Comixology_Ubooquity_2/wiki/Getting-Started
